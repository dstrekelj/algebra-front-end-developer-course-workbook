        <h1>1. Markup languages</h1>
        <p>A <em>markup language</em> is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.</p>
        <p>Types of markup languages</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Presentational markup</strong> - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word).</li>
            <li><strong>Procedural markup</strong> - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX).</li>
            <li><strong>Descriptive (logical) markup</strong> - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>1.2. HTML</h2>
        <p><i>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</i> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>
        <p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.</p>
        <h3>1.2.1. How the browser displays HTML</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree.</li>
            <li>The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree.</li>
            <li>A layout is generated from the render tree.</li>
            <li>The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.</li>
        </ol>
