# Exercise #0 - Components

> This exercise can require knowledge from all examples.

This exercise represents a collection of commonly used components in web design.

Every component folder contains a design and any additional materials required
to create the component.

Your task is to recreate the components in HTML and CSS as closely as possible
to the given design. Keep in mind that these are _components_ and should be 
easily used together, sometimes even multiple times per page, so do not use
overy generic class names or write style declarations with side effects.
