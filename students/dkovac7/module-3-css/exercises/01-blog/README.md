# Exercise #1 - Blog

> This exercise requires knowledge from examples #1 - #23.

A blog design is given in Figma. See it [here](https://www.figma.com/file/B522vtVzrm18rqefgIYy3q/Exercise-Blog?node-id=7%3A911).

The design contains "Thumbnail", "Style guide", and "Pages" artboards. Use the "Style guide" and "Pages" artboards to code the layout.

The "Style guide" artboard contains references to used typography, colours, and visual components. Its intent is to simplify project development by creating smaller components first, and combining them into complex pages later.

The "Pages" artboard contains the design of two pages, the "Home" page and "Single" page.

The "Home" page presents the visitor with a blog roll or feed. Every item (post) in the feed contains a "Read more" link that - when clicked - navigates the visitor to the single page of the selected item.

The "Single" page presents the visitor with the contents of a blog post. The visitor can navigate back to the home page by clicking the "Back to blog" link.

Both pages also contain a header and footer.

The title in the header must be a link to the home page.

The email in the footer must be an email link.

Tips:

* When opening the design in Figma, use the top left hamburger button to navigate between artboards
* Log into a Figma account in order to measure the size and distance between components, as well as other properties (e.g. colour, font size)
