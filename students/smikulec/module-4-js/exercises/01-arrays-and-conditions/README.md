# Exercise #1 - Arrays and Conditions

You're a student who has just finished taking a math exam. Something about a prime number question from the exam is bothering you, so you're going to have your computer figure out the answer for you.

Write a function named `countPrimeNumbers` accepting two parameters:

* `from` - the number from which to begin counting prime numbers.
* `to` - the number up to which to end counting prime numbers (inclusive).

The function requirements are:

1. The function must count the number of prime numbers present between values `from` and `to` (including `to`).
2. The function must return the prime number count.

**Example:**

Input: 

```js
countPrimeNumbers(10, 20);
```

Output:

```
4
```

* Solve the problem using different types of loops
* Test your function by using different arguments
* Remember to check if the function is being called with the correct arguments
