        <h3>1. Markup languages</h3>
        <p>A <strong>markup language</strong> is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. <strong>Markup languages</strong>  are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.</p>
    
        <h4>Types of markup languages</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong> Presentational markup</strong> - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word). </li>
            <li><strong> Procedural markup</strong> - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX). </li>
            <li><strong> Descriptive (logical) markup</strong> - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>1.2. HTML</h3>

        <p> <b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>

        <p><b>HTML</b> consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.</p>
        <h5>1.2.1. How the browser displays HTML</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>The browser parses the <strong>HTML</strong> to construct the <strong>DOM</strong> tree.</li>
            <li>The <strong>DOM</strong> tree is used to construct a render tree.</li>
            <li>A layout is generated from the render tree.</li>
            <li>The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.</li>
        </ol>
