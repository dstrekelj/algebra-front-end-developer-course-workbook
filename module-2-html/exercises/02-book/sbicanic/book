    <h1><b>1. Markup languages</b></h1>
    <br>
    <p>A <strong>markup language</strong> is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Types of markup languages: <br>
        - <strong>Presentational markup</strong> - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word). <br>
        - <strong>Procedural markup</strong> - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX). 
        <br>
        - <strong>Descriptive (logical) markup</strong> - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).
    </p><br>

    <h2>1.2. HTML</h2>
    <p><strong>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br>
    HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.</p><br>

    <h3>1.2.1. How the browser displays HTML</h3> 
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree.</li>
        <li>The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree.</li>
        <li>A layout is generated from the render tree.</li>
        <li>The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.</li>
    </ol>
