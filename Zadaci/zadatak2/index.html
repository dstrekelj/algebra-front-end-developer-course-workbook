                <h1>1. Markup languages</h1>
                        
                    <p>A <b>markup language</b> is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.</p>

                <strong>Types of markup languages</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Presentational markup</b> - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word).</li>
                        <li><b>Procedural markup</b> - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX).</li>
                        <li><b>Descriptive (logical) markup</b> - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>1.2. HTML</h2>

                    <p><b><u>HyperText Markup Language (HTML</u>)</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>

                    <p>HTML consists of a series of <b>elements</b>, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.</p>

                <h3>1.2.1. How the browser displays HTML</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree.</li>
                        <li>The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree.</li>
                        <li>A layout is generated from the render tree.</li>
                        <li>The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.</li>
                    </ol>

                <h2>1.4. Definitions</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>HTML</b> - HyperText Markup Language</li>
                        <li><b>DOM</b> - Document Object Model</li>
                    </ul>
